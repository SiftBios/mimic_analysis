# Domain Enrichment Analysis Acceleration Plan

## Current Understanding
- The domain enrichment analysis compares frequency of PFAM domains in cancer-specific sequences vs. global dataset
- Main computational bottleneck is in `analyze_binding_domain_intersections` function in data_processor.py
- Frontend visualization in domain_enrichment.js also has inefficiencies

## Identified Bottlenecks

### Server-side (data_processor.py)
- **File I/O**: Repeated FASTA file reads for each sequence
- **Nested Loops**: Multiple nested loops for domain and binding intersection analysis
- **Memory Usage**: Inefficient data structure usage and excessive copying
- **Pandas Overhead**: Frequent DataFrame conversions and reindexing
- **Suboptimal Parallelism**: Thread usage doesn't efficiently distribute work

### Client-side (domain_enrichment.js)
- **Excessive Polling**: Continuous polling of task status
- **Complex Visualizations**: Matrix creation with O(n²) complexity
- **Data Processing**: Client-side filtering and transformations on large datasets

## Conclusion

We have successfully implemented all planned optimizations to improve the performance of the domain enrichment analysis workflow. The optimizations include:

2. Optimized domain-binding intersection algorithm using efficient data structures
3. Reduced memory usage through better data structures and memory management
4. Improved parallelism with better work distribution
5. Frontend optimizations including exponential backoff polling and DOM caching

These changes should significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of the domain enrichment analysis, especially for large datasets.

To validate these improvements, run comprehensive tests with both small and large datasets to measure:
